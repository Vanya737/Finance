 People often spend money 
 impulsively, without tracking their expenses or planning a budget. 
 This can lead to debt, financial instability, and even loss of housing.

 ## Reasons:
   1. Lack of financial literacy: Many people do not have sufficient 
      knowledge about how to manage their finances. 
       
   2.  The difficulty of tracking expenses: In today's world with many 
       payment methods 
       (cash, cards, online payments), it is difficult to track all expenses.

   3.   Psychological factors: Impulsive purchases, fear of missing out (FOMO) and other 
        psychological factors can lead to irrational spending.
