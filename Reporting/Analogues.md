### Money Flow

One of the most popular where currencies in rubles, dollars and euros are available. 
You can also add accounts from which you spent money and set reminders here.

Annual subscription — 899 rubles, monthly subscription — 269 rubles.

Available on: AppStore

To make it easier for the user to get acquainted with the program's features, Money Flow
has added demo data that can be deleted and added its own. However, using the app without a 
subscription is not very convenient: it allows you to make income and expenses, but does not allow you to 
choose spending categories.


## The main disadvantages of such applications are

  ### 1. Limited functionality:
   A paid subscription is usually required to access more advanced features.

  ### 2. Dependence on Internet connection:
   
   Most financial applications require an internet connection to synchronize data, 
   update, and access features.

   A weak or unstable Internet connection can interfere with the use of 
   the application and lead to data loss.

  ### 3. Privacy concerns:
   Financial applications process sensitive information such as 
   bank account numbers, transaction amounts, and personal data.

   It is important to carefully study the privacy policy of the selected 
   application and make sure that its security measures are reliable.
