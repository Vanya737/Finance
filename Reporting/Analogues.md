### Money Flow

One of the most popular where currencies in rubles, dollars and euros are available. 
You can also add accounts from which you spent money and set reminders here.

Annual subscription — 899 rubles, monthly subscription — 269 rubles.

Available on: AppStore

To make it easier for the user to get acquainted with the program's features, Money Flow
has added demo data that can be deleted and added its own. However, using the app without a 
subscription is not very convenient: it allows you to make income and expenses, but does not allow you to 
choose spending categories.
